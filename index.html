        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>My dad and grandad were both Jazz enthousiasts and record collectors with - if I may say so - excellent taste. They were especially interested in Bebop and Hard Bop and owned many early and original pressings. Several well worn Down Beat's Jazz Record Reviews volumes are still on the bookshelf.</p> 
        <p>I am a selection of these records to enable others to enjoy them. All sales will go through Discogs (<a href="https://www.discogs.com/seller/rvdweerd.github.io/profile" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my store</a>, <a href="https://www.discogs.com/user/rvdweerd.github.io/collection" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my collection</a>) of ebay (occasional auctions, <a href="https://www.ebay.com/usr/roger-nl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my handle</a>).</p>
        <p>Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or want more detailed information on the records that are for sale.</p>
